<p>Lion Jones, Privacy Policy:</p>

<p>This is the privacy policy of &bdquo;Lion Jones&ldquo;. Thank you for playing my game, it was a lot of hard work and sweat to get here, and im thankful for everyone who&rsquo;s interested in it :-))</p>
<br>
<p>What information do i collect?</p>

<p>I have no usage purpose for any kind of personal information. However, because &bdquo;Lion Jones&ldquo; is a free game, i need to display third party advertisements to generate some income.</p>

<p>These third party advertisement frameworks DO collect your personal information. And &bdquo;they&ldquo; don&rsquo;t allow any advertisements to be displayed without some kind of personal information from you being collected.</p>

<p>This information or &bdquo;data&ldquo; is used to measure the efficiency and performance of their ad&rsquo;s, how long was the ad viewed, was the advertisement viewed to the end or was it skipped etc. These third party advertisers are:</p>

<p>1. Google Admob</p>
<p>2. APPLOVIN</p>

<p>This list might change if or when i need to add more advertisement frameworks, in case of problems with current ad&rsquo;s or insufficient advertisement coverage for my users.</p>

<p>This is the information collected by the third party advertisement frameworks:</p>

<p>1. IP address, which may be used to estimate the general location of a device</p>

<p>2. Non-user related crash logs, which may be used to diagnose problems. Diagnostics information may also be used for advertising and analytic purposes.</p>

<p>3. User-associated performance data such as app launch time, hang rate, or energy usage, which may be used to evaluate user behavior, understand the effectiveness of existing product features. Performance data may also be used for displaying ad&rsquo;s, including sharing with other entities that display ads.</p>

<p>4. A device ID such as the device&rsquo;s advertising identifier or other app-bounded device identifiers, which may be used for the purpose of third-party advertising and analytics. (You can reset the advertising ID of your device in your system settings)</p>

<p>5. Advertising data, such as advertisements the user has seen, may be used to power analytics and advertising features.</p>

<p>6. Other user product interactions like app launch taps, and interaction information, like video views, may be used to improve advertising performance.</p>

<p>Furthermore, my game &bdquo;Lion Jones&ldquo; uses a third party API to get the current local time from the user to be able to gift &bdquo;Daily Bonus&ldquo; prizes correctly, and prevent cheating. Therefore, when you (the user) starts the game &bdquo;Lion Jones&ldquo; or opens the &bdquo;Daily Bonus&ldquo; menu, a brief connection to that third party time API is established, and some of your information is handed over to this API to be able to determine your coarse location and timezone. Without this third party API service, the user could just keep changing the system device time and get unlimited amount of daily prizes gifted. To circumvent this, i am using this third-party time API service.</p>

<p>Please refer to the privacy notice of this time API service for further information on how they process your data. -LINK-</p>

<p>Additionally, if you ask for help through the &bdquo;support&ldquo; button in the settings menu, i might retain the personal information you provide including the content of that communication. You can contact me at &bdquo;@&ldquo; if you wish for your information to be deleted.</p>

<p>&bdquo;Lion Jones&ldquo; offers in-app purchases, you can buy game items and unlock other features with real money. You can disable in-app purchases in your device settings if you don&rsquo;t want to use them.</p>
